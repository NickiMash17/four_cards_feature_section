## My process
To create the "Four Card Feature Section" webpage, follow these steps:

1.Set Up the Project Structure:
-Create a project directory.
-Inside the directory, create the following files and folders:
    -index.html
    -style.css
    -images/ (place your images here)

2.Develop the HTML Structure:

-Use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your content.
-Include a header for the main title and description.
-Create a section to contain the four feature cards.
-Ensure each card has a heading, descriptive text, and an image.

3.Apply CSS Styling:

-Use the :root pseudo-class to define CSS variables for colors and fonts.
-Implement Flexbox or CSS Grid for responsive layout.
-Style the header and cards to match the desired design.
-Add media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

4.Optimize for Responsiveness:

-Test the webpage on various devices and screen sizes.
-Adjust CSS properties as needed to maintain a consistent and user-friendly design.

5.Validate and Test:
-Ensure the HTML and CSS are valid and free of errors.
-Test all links and interactive elements for functionality.


By following these steps, you can build a responsive and visually appealing "Four Card Feature Section" that aligns with modern web development practices.
